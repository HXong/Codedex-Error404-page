# Codedex-Error404-page
Making my first webpage using html, CSS and JavaScript
Started this challenge as a side hobby that I wanted to experience. 
Right now, i am studying C, python as well as Java during my Y1 in university. I have not touched on any frontend programming before, so this was a side challenge i set for myself to explore more into this field. 
This was my first webpage project, not really the best, but i will take it as a learning point from here
